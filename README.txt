BAUM is a software library for drawing and recognize circular barcodes
that are designed to be relatively tolerant of linear motion blur.
This library allows recognizing those circular barcodes from video in
real time from Full HD videos utilizing a desktop GPU. All recognition
task is executed by an OpenCL device, and thus CPU load is very low if
a GPU is used as the OpenCL device.
